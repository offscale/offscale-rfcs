OS + Docker packaging
=====================

Think [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com), but for arbitrary stacks rather than simply static binaries.

## OS specific
Design DSL for creating OS-specific packages, like `.deb`s, `.rpm`s and `msi`s.

## Docker
Take these OS specific packages and generate Dockerfiles that utilise them, based off the ones successfully generated. E.g.: Alpine, Debian, Ubuntu, Windows.
