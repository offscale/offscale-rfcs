[offprojects] Concepts
======================

## Problem

When bringing on a new client, there are a variety of things we in software-engineering must do. These include:

### Project management

#### Team management and communication

### Version control
Creating and maintaining new version control repositories (e.g.: on GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab, others, and/or internal systems)

### CI/CD

### Auditing
Security, testing, documentation, sometimes proofing also

### System alerting

### Finances
Budget control, allocation, payroll and contract payment (invoicing and payment of invoices)

### Forecasting
Heavily integrated with project management and finances.

### Activity sharing
Communicate internal and externally (to stakeholders). Can range from simple things like feature and bug progress, to more long-term things like roadmap and multi-project—program or even portfolio—views.

## Solution

Still figuring this out.

### Potential solution(s)

  0. Create a centralised system that does this all out of the box;
  1. Like 0, but create many small modules that link together (think longterm: [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning))
  2. Integrate with many APIs, so that you can easily create everything for a new project, without needing to build the reliant systems ourselves;
  3. 2., but with a common interface to all features (e.g.: with embedding, with browser addons, with desktop and mobile apps)
